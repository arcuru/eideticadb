//! EideticaDB: A decentralized database designed to "Remember Everything".
//! This library provides the core components for building and interacting with EideticaDB instances.
//!
//! ## Core Concepts
//!
//! EideticaDB is built around several key concepts:
//!
//! * **Entries (`entry::Entry`)**: The fundamental, content-addressable unit of data. Entries contain data for a main tree and optional named subtrees.
//! * **Trees (`basedb::Tree`)**: Analogous to tables or branches, representing a history of related entries identified by a root entry ID.
//! * **Backends (`backend::Backend`)**: A pluggable storage layer for persisting entries.
//! * **BaseDB (`basedb::BaseDB`)**: The main database struct that manages trees and interacts with a backend.
//! * **CRDTs (`data::CRDT`)**: Conflict-free Replicated Data Types used for merging data from different entries, particularly for settings and subtree data.
//! * **Merkle-CRDT**: The underlying principle combining Merkle DAGs (formed by entries and parent links) with CRDTs for efficient, decentralized data synchronization.
