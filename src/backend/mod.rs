/// and querying entries and their relationships within trees and subtrees.
/// Implementations of this trait handle the specifics of how data is persisted
/// (e.g., in memory, on disk, in a remote database).
///
/// Much of the performance-critical logic, particularly concerning tree traversal
/// and tip calculation, resides within `Backend` implementations, as the optimal
/// approach often depends heavily on the underlying storage characteristics.
///
/// All backend implementations must be `Send` and `Sync` to allow sharing across threads,
/// and implement `Any` to allow for downcasting if needed.
