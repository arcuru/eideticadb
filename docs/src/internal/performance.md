## Performance Considerations

The current architecture has several performance implications:

- **Content-addressable storage**: Enables efficient deduplication. Uses SHA-256 for IDs; the probability of hash collisions is negligible for practical purposes and is likely not explicitly handled.
- **Tree structure (DAG)**: Allows for partial replication and sparse checkouts (via tip-based operations). Tip calculation in `InMemoryBackend` appears to involve checking parent lists across entries, potentially leading to \(O(N^2)\) complexity in naive cases, though optimizations might exist. Diff calculations (not explicitly implemented) would depend on history traversal.
- **`InMemoryBackend`**: Offers high speed for reads/writes but lacks persistence beyond save/load to file. Scalability is limited by available RAM.
- **Lock-based concurrency (`Arc<Mutex<...>>` for `Backend`)**: May become a bottleneck in high-concurrency scenarios, especially with write-heavy workloads. Needs analysis. <!-- TODO: Analyze lock contention points. Consider alternative concurrency models (e.g., lock-free structures, sharding) for future development. -->
- **Height calculation and topological sorting**: The `InMemoryBackend` uses a BFS-based approach (similar to Kahn's algorithm) with complexity expected to be roughly \(O(V + E)\), where V is the number of entries and E is the number of parent links in the relevant context.
  <!-- TODO: Add benchmarks or profiling results if available. -->
  <!-- TODO: Discuss potential optimizations, e.g., caching, indexing strategies (if applicable). -->
